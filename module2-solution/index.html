                    This is a classic Sunday dinner that the whole family will love. It’s super simple too. Always try to buy the best quality chicken you can afford – aim for RSPCA-Assured birds as a minimum, then trade up when you can. I’ve seen the way low-standard chickens are kept and I’d never feed them to my kids.

Other parts that are eaten include the oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe from the reticulum or rumen, glands &lpar;particularly the pancreas and thymus, referred to as sweetbread&rpar;, the heart, the brain &lpar;although forbidden where there is a danger of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE&rpar;, the kidneys, and the tender testicles of the bull &lpar;known in the United States as calf fries, prairie oysters, or Rocky Mountain oysters&rpar;.
